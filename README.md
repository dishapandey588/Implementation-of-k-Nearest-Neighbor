# Implementation-of-k-Nearest-Neighbor

1.	First we, create a random two dimensional classification dataset (N=100) using the make_classification function in sci-kit learn and assign a different color to each class uniformly at random and plot it using matplotib.
2.	Then we generate 10 new points that belong to the same input space. Plot them using a different color in the above plot.
3.	We write the unweighted K Nearest Neighbor API from scratch and try to define the class appropriately such that knn object instances with different values of k can be created
4.	We draw the decision boundaries when k equals 1, 10 and 100.
5.	Instantiate the k nearest neighbor from scikit-learn and compare the decision boundaries and labels obtained
6.	Then we repeat the above steps for a random two dimensional regression dataset using the make_regression function in sci-kit learn
